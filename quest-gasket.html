  <!-- OVERVIEW -->
  <section class="cs-section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Quest Gasket is an industrial sealing manufacturer whose legacy website made it
      difficult for customers to find the correct product family, series, or technical
      information. The structure was flat, the navigation was unclear, and internal
      staff often had to guide buyers manually.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company also wanted to introduce an online store—but the existing architecture
      couldn’t scale to support ecommerce. My goal was to modernize the site, reorganize
      the product structure, and design a sitemap flexible enough for current needs and
      future growth.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CHALLENGE + GOALS -->
  <section class="cs-section cs-two-column">

    <div>
      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        The original website suffered from major UX issues:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unclear and inconsistent product categories</li>
        <li>No hierarchy to guide users through families and series</li>
        <li>No ecommerce system or supporting structure</li>
        <li>Outdated navigation and terminology</li>
        <li>High reliance on manual support and quoting</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>The biggest challenge:</strong></p>
      <p>
        Reorganizing the product catalog <em>and</em> creating an information architecture
        that could support a future online store—something the existing structure simply
        couldn’t handle.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Project Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Build a clean, scalable sitemap for a large product catalog</li>
        <li>Modernize patterns to reflect current UX standards</li>
        <li>Create a structure that supports both browsing and “I know what I need” flows</li>
        <li>Prepare the site for ecommerce implementation</li>
        <li>Deliver a clickable prototype to validate the flow before development</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

  <!-- PROCESS -->
  <section class="cs-section">
    <h2>Process</h2>

    <article class="cs-subsection">
      <h3>1. Website Audit</h3>
      <p>
        I began by auditing the existing site. This included documenting navigation gaps,
        redundant pages, inconsistent naming, and unclear product groupings. The audit revealed
        that users had no clear path to move from category → product → specification.
      </p>

      <figure class="cs-figure placeholder">
        <div class="placeholder-box">
          <span>Screenshot of original website / audit notes</span>
        </div>
        <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </article>

    <article class="cs-subsection">
      <h3>2. Information Architecture & Sitemap</h3>
      <p>
        Working with the client, I created a new sitemap that introduced a clear hierarchy:
        <em>product families → series → specifications/materials</em>. This aligned with how
        customers actually search and how internal teams describe products.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sitemap went through several iterations, ensuring it remained flexible enough to
        support the planned online store.
      </p>

      <figure class="cs-figure">
        <div class="placeholder-box">
          <span>Final sitemap after client consultation</span>
        </div>
        <figcaption>
          Final sitemap designed to scale as new products and ecommerce features are added.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </article>

    <article class="cs-subsection">
      <h3>3. Wireframing the New Website</h3>
      <p>
        I produced low-fidelity wireframes using Balsamiq for the home page, navigation levels,
        product pages, technical information, and ecommerce paths. These wireframes were
        hot-spotted to create a clickable prototype that stakeholders could navigate.
      </p>

      <div class="cs-grid">
        <figure class="cs-figure">

      </div>
    </article>

    <article class="cs-subsection">
      <h3>4. Product Page System</h3>
      <p>
        Quest Gasket’s catalog includes many unique product types, so I designed a reusable,
        flexible system for product detail pages. Each template supports technical data,
        drawings, downloadable resources, and clear actions such as “Request a Quote” or
        “Add to Cart” (for future ecommerce).

  <!-- OUTCOME / RESULTS -->
  <section class="cs-section">
    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      The final sitemap and wireframes were presented through a clickable prototype.
      After review and small refinements, the design was approved and handed off to
      development with clear documentation.
    </p>

    <ul class="cs-results">
      <li>Created a scalable structure for a large and complex product catalog.</li>
      <li>Introduced Quest Gasket’s first ecommerce-ready website framework.</li>
      <li>Clarified navigation patterns and reduced redundancy across pages.</li>
      <li>Delivered an interactive prototype to align stakeholders before build.</li>
    </ul>
