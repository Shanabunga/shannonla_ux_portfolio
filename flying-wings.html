    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section class="cs-section">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Flying Wings is a white-label travel booking platform created for a client based in China.
        The project was initiated through a Canadian partner who works primarily in the airline
        industry. They provided a high-level sitemap and needed a desktop flight booking experience
        that could be branded for their client and reused for future airline partners.
      </p>
      <p>
        I designed both non-branded and branded high-fidelity prototypes in Figma, covering the full
        booking journey from search to checkout. The goal was to deliver a realistic, clickable
        experience that could be used in client presentations and as a foundation for development.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- CHALLENGE + GOALS -->
    <section class="cs-section cs-two-column">
      <div>
        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>The team needed a booking flow that worked for two different purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A realistic flight booking experience for travelers.</li>
          <li>A clean, structured demo that sales could present to potential clients.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Starting from only a basic sitemap, the design had to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Look modern and trustworthy for an international audience.</li>
          <li>Be easy to rebrand for different airline and travel partners.</li>
          <li>Show a complete journey from homepage to confirmation.</li>
          <li>Be fully clickable so stakeholders could “feel” the experience.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Create an end-to-end flow (search → results → details → checkout → confirmation).</li>
          <li>Support both non-branded and branded UI states.</li>
          <li>Use patterns that are familiar from modern travel sites.</li>
          <li>Design a layout that can be easily white-labeled for future clients.</li>
          <li>Deliver a Figma prototype with hotspot interactions for demos and reviews.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

      <h2>Process</h2>

      <!-- 1. Sitemap & Structure -->
      <article class="cs-subsection">
        <h3>1. Client Sitemap & Structure</h3>
        <p>
          The client provided a simple sitemap with top-level navigation:
          <em>Air, Hotels, Cars, About Us, Contact Us</em>. From there, I expanded the structure
          into a complete flow that supported:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Homepage with hero area and destination specials.</li>
          <li>Flight search module with trip type, cabin class, and passengers.</li>
          <li>Search results with outbound and inbound options.</li>
          <li>Trip summary and detailed pricing.</li>
          <li>Checkout with passenger and billing information.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- 2. Low-Fidelity Wireframes -->
      <article class="cs-subsection">
        <h3>2. Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
        <p>
          Using Balsamiq, I created low-fidelity wireframes to define layout and hierarchy before
          moving into visual design. The wireframes focused on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A clear homepage with a search module and featured destinations.</li>
          <li>Simple, scannable flight results with pricing and trip time details.</li>
          <li>A checkout page that balances detail with clarity and trust.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="cs-grid">
          <figure class="cs-figure">
            <div class="placeholder-box">

      <article class="cs-subsection">
        <h3>3. Non-Branded High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
        <p>
          Once the flow and layout were validated, I moved into a non-branded high-fidelity
          prototype. This version established:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Typography scale and visual hierarchy.</li>
          <li>Form styles for the search and checkout steps.</li>
          <li>Card-based layout for destination specials.</li>
          <li>Consistent headers, footers, and navigation patterns.</li>

      <!-- 4. Branded Prototype -->
      <article class="cs-subsection">
        <h3>4. Branded High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
        <p>
          With the base experience in place, I created a branded version tailored to the client’s
          airline partner. This included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Custom colors and brand typography.</li>
          <li>Travel imagery reflecting key destinations.</li>

      <!-- 5. Search, Results & Selection -->
      <article class="cs-subsection">
        <h3>5. Search, Results & Selection Flow</h3>
        <p>
          The core booking flow centered on making it easy to search, compare, and select flights.
          The results layout included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Outbound and inbound flight lists with pricing.</li>
          <li>Trip duration, layovers, and “Direct” labels.</li>

      <article class="cs-subsection">
        <h3>6. Trip Summary & Checkout</h3>
        <p>
          After selecting flights, users see a combined trip summary and price breakdown, followed by
          passenger and billing forms. The checkout flow was designed to be familiar and
          trustworthy, with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear outbound and inbound flight details.</li>
          <li>Base price and taxes/fees separated.</li>
          <li>Fields for passenger information and contact details.</li>
          <li>Billing address and payment-related details.</li>
          <li>Visible terms and conditions to build trust.</li>

      <article class="cs-subsection">
        <h3>7. Interactive Prototype</h3>
        <p>
          To support remote reviews and client demos, I created a fully hot-spotted prototype in
          Figma. Stakeholders could click through:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Homepage → Search → Results.</li>
          <li>Flight selection and trip summary.</li>
          <li>Checkout and confirmation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The prototype is currently used in beta for internal and client-facing presentations.

        The final deliverable included both non-branded and branded high-fidelity prototypes, along
