    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section class="cs-section">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Flying Wings is a white-label flight booking experience created for a client based in China,
        through a Canadian partner in the airline industry. They provided a high-level sitemap and
        needed a desktop booking flow that could be branded for their client and reused for future
        airline partners.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike some of my inherited projects, Flying Wings was a rare opportunity to build the
        system from the ground up. I designed the end-to-end booking journey
        <em>and</em> created a reusable design system – a UI and interaction foundation that makes it
        fast to re-skin, extend, and scale the product for new clients.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- CHALLENGE + GOALS -->
    <section class="cs-section cs-two-column">
      <div>
        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>The team needed a booking flow that served two audiences at once:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Travelers who expect a familiar, trustworthy booking experience.</li>
          <li>Sales teams who need a polished, clickable demo for potential clients.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We started with only a basic sitemap. From there, the challenge was to turn that into:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A complete search → results → checkout → confirmation journey.</li>
          <li>A visual system that could be rebranded for future partners without starting over.</li>
          <li>One source of truth for components, forms, and layout patterns.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The biggest opportunity – and the piece I’m most proud of – was establishing a
          <strong>design system</strong> that made the experience both consistent and highly reusable.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Create an end-to-end booking flow from homepage to confirmation.</li>
          <li>Design a non-branded base and a fully branded version for Flying Wings.</li>
          <li>Build a reusable design system (colors, type, components, patterns).</li>
          <li>Use booking patterns that feel familiar to modern travel users.</li>
          <li>Deliver a clickable Figma prototype for demos and development handoff.</li>

    <!-- DESIGN SYSTEM (BIG HIGHLIGHT) -->
    <section class="cs-section">
      <h2>Design System Foundations</h2>
      <p>
        Because Flying Wings needed to scale across multiple airline partners, I built a full
        white-label design system from scratch. The system defined color, typography, components,
        and interaction states so future brands could be launched quickly without redesigning the
        experience each time.
      </p>

      <!-- Theme & typography -->

        <p>
          The client provided a simple sitemap with top-level navigation:
          <em>Air, Hotels, Cars, About Us, Contact Us</em>. From there, I expanded the structure
          into a complete flow that supported:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Homepage with hero area and destination specials.</li>

        <h3>3. Non-Branded High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
        <p>
          With the layout validated, I moved into a non-branded high-fidelity prototype using the
          design system foundations. This version established:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Typography and color usage across the interface.</li>
          <li>Form styles and field groupings for search and checkout.</li>

          The core booking flow needed to be easy to scan and compare. The results layout included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Separate outbound and inbound flight lists with pricing.</li>
          <li>Trip duration, layovers, and “Direct” indicators.</li>

        <p>
          After flight selection, users see a combined trip summary and price breakdown, followed by
          passenger and billing forms. The design system ensured:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Consistent typography and spacing across all form sections.</li>
          <li>Clear hierarchy between outbound, inbound, and price details.</li>

        <p>
          To support remote reviews and client demos, I created a fully hot-spotted prototype in
          Figma. Stakeholders could click through:

        <ul>
          <li>Homepage → Search → Results</li>

        The final deliverable included both a non-branded white-label base and a Flying Wings
