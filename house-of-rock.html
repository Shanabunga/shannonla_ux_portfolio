    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section class="cs-section">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        House of Rock is a large-scale platform that combines concert discovery, travel booking, and
        social networking in one experience. Users can discover concerts, book flights, hotels and
        car rentals, connect with “Bandmates”, share posts, and build travel packages around shows
        they want to attend.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an ongoing, multi-phase project. The product already existed when I joined, and I was
        brought in to evaluate the existing experience, redesign key flows and components, and deliver
        high-fidelity prototypes that improve clarity, usability, and consistency across mobile and desktop.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- CHALLENGE + GOALS -->
    <section class="cs-section cs-two-column">
      <div>
        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          The client’s vision was ambitious: become a leader in packaging concerts and travel into
          a single platform. A previous designer had created initial mockups, but they:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Used inconsistent patterns across screens.</li>
          <li>Did not follow common social or travel app conventions.</li>
          <li>Made navigation and user control unclear.</li>
          <li>Did not fully support the “Take me there” concept.</li>
          <li>Overlooked important aspects like security and privacy settings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          My task was to inherit the existing work, identify gaps, and redesign core experiences
          while keeping the client’s creative direction in mind.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Improve the Bandmates social experience (profiles, news feed, posting, connections).</li>
          <li>Refine travel booking flows for concerts, flights, hotels, and packages.</li>
          <li>Introduce clearer navigation and better user control.</li>
          <li>Design custom UI components aligned with the brand’s music theme.</li>
          <li>Highlight and address privacy, security, and feature gaps.</li>
          <li>Deliver interactive prototypes for client reviews and dev handoff.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

      <h2>Process</h2>

      <!-- 1. Heuristic Evaluation -->
      <article class="cs-subsection">
        <h3>1. Heuristic Evaluation & Experience Audit</h3>
        <p>
          I began with a full audit of the existing designs, using heuristic evaluation to assess:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bandmates profile pages and social feeds.</li>
          <li>News feed and posting functionality.</li>
          <li>Desktop vacation package search and trip builder.</li>
          <li>Mobile booking and “Take me there” interactions.</li>
          <li>Account and login flows.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The audit surfaced issues around consistency, control, visibility of system status, and
          missing security and privacy flows. I documented the findings and provided time estimates
          for addressing each area.
        </p>

      <!-- 2. Bandmates Redesign -->
      <article class="cs-subsection">
        <h3>2. Bandmates: Social Experience Redesign</h3>
        <p>
          The Bandmates area is where users connect with friends, see which concerts they’re
          attending, and decide whether to join them. An earlier design existed, but it did not
          fully match user expectations from modern social platforms.
        </p>
        <p>Key improvements included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Restructuring the user profile to follow familiar patterns (relationship status, music
            profile, social links, bio, photos and videos).
          </li>
          <li>
            Improving navigation so users can move back and forth easily within the Bandmates area.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designing clearer “Bandmate News” cards that highlight where friends are going and which
            concerts they plan to attend.
          </li>
          <li>
            Focusing on the “Take me there” functionality so users can quickly select the same
            concert and start building their own trip.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- 3. Social Feed & Posting -->
      <article class="cs-subsection">
        <h3>3. Social Feed & Posting Patterns</h3>
        <p>
          The social feed showed posts from users sharing concerts, trips, and experiences. I
          refined these patterns to make:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Posts more scannable, with clearer hierarchy and metadata.</li>
          <li>Engagement actions (“Like”, “Comment”, “Share”) more consistent.</li>
          <li>Artist and event information stand out as the focal point.</li>

      <!-- 4. Custom UI Components -->
      <article class="cs-subsection">
        <h3>4. Custom UI Components for the Brand</h3>
        <p>
          To reinforce the House of Rock brand and theme, the client requested several custom
          components to use in social and travel flows.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Ticket stub component:</strong> used for user connections under Bandmates,
            allowing users to accept or decline new connections with a concert-ticket feel.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Concert ticket news card:</strong> styled like a boarding pass to show where
            friends are going and which artist they’re seeing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sound equalizer trip builder element:</strong> a visual equalizer that animates
            as users configure their travel package (flights, hotels, car rental).
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- 5. Mobile Booking Experience -->
      <article class="cs-subsection">
        <h3>5. Mobile Booking Experience</h3>
        <p>
          Much of the early work focused on improving the mobile experience, especially for users
          discovering concerts through Bandmates and then booking trips to join their friends.
        </p>
        <p>The flow connects:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bandmate news about an upcoming concert.</li>
          <li>“Take me there” entry point into the booking journey.</li>
          <li>
            Flight, hotel, and car selection screens with multiple options (direct vs multi-stop, trip
            times, and pricing).
          </li>
          <li>Trip summary and confirmation.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- 6. Desktop Vacation Package & Trip Builder -->
      <article class="cs-subsection">
        <h3>6. Desktop Vacation Package & Trip Builder</h3>
        <p>
          On desktop, the vacation package screen needed to support complex search behavior without
          overwhelming users. I redesigned the search panel and trip builder to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Introduce a “Build a trip” pattern with clear options.</li>
          <li>Allow users to choose two or more items (flights, hotels, cars).</li>
          <li>Support one-way and return trip types.</li>
          <li>Clarify origin, destination, dates, and traveler counts.</li>
          <li>Integrate concert search by artist, event, or city.</li>
        </ul>

        <figure class="cs-figure">
          <div class="placeholder-box">
            <span>Redesigned desktop vacation package builder</span>

          </figcaption>

        <p>
          This redesign also aligned related areas such as featured artists and hotel sections with the
          overall layout and interaction style.

      <!-- 7. Account & Login Updates -->
      <article class="cs-subsection">
        <h3>7. Account & Login Flow</h3>
        <p>
          I also refined the login and registration screen to better support account creation and
          trust. Improvements included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clearer password requirements and age confirmation.</li>
          <li>Explicit terms and privacy policy acceptance.</li>
          <li>Social login options for faster onboarding.</li>
